# AI/ML Based Sensitive Data Discovery and Classification of Unstructured Data Sources
# Overview
The volume of the data owned by organizations is growing rapidly. It is estimated that 80-90% of the data is in unstructured format. <br />
As per Forbes, almost 95% businesses are struggling to manage unstructured data. <br />

Types of Sensitive Data: <br />
PII - Personally Identifiable Information <br />
SPI - Sensitive Personal Information <br />
PHI - Protected Health Information <br />
NPI - Non-public Personal Information <br />

# Project Objectives:
1. Detect sensitive elements contained in the unstructured document using Regular Expressions <br />
2. Rule based document Risk categorization: High, Medium, Low <br />
3. Auto classify the document as Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted using Multi Class Classification Model <br />

# Dataset:
Since the project simulation needs sensitive information, synthetic data which mimics PII was generated while preserving the format and data type. <br /> 
This dataset will be used as an input to train the model to auto-detect the sensitive data elements and classify the document. <br />
